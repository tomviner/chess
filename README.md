chess
=====

My friend Rich and I have been playing chess for about a quater century.
We used to play in each other's houses, but now he lives 600 miles away.
So my aim is to make an online chess board we can play on again.
I plan to use Python and TDD.

To get to the end goal of _two way web chess_ I need to progress through these milestones:

Stage 1
-------

- A **board** that can
    - place pieces
    - display itself
    - move pieces
- A **game** that can
    - initialise a board
    - take input from a player
